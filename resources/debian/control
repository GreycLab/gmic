Description: GREYC's Magic for Image Computing
 G'MIC is a full-featured open-source framework for image processing.
 It provides several different user interfaces to convert/manipulate/filter/visualize
 generic image datasets, ranging from 1D scalar signals to 3D+t sequences of
 multi-spectral volumetric images, including 2D color images.
 .
 This package contains the command-line tool (gmic), the plug-in for gimp (gmic_gimp),
 the library file (libgmic) and the webcam gui (zart).
